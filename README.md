## Instruction to run
This is currently only a simple html-css-js project. Frameworks may be added when the simplicity becomes a bottleneck. 

To run, download the repo and just start a simple server 
```
python -m http.server
```

Go to ```localhost:8000``` on Chrome to see the site (as opposed to 0.0.0.0:8000) as camera on Chrome only runs on https or localhost. Then click on the debug card. That has eval running.
